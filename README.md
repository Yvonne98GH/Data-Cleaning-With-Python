In this data cleaning project, we embark on a journey to ensure data integrity and enhance analysis by addressing missing and null values.
We identify gaps in the dataset and strategically fill them using appropriate techniques, such as mean imputation or forward/backward filling.
Through visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn, we gain insights into the distribution of data before and after cleaning.
